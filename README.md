# Sand Piles on Cellular Automatons and Random Graphs
Models of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld, Manna, Feders and stochastic Feders sand piles on cellular automaton and random graphs in Python 3

v1.2 - Added alternative pattern of sand grains addition into the systems (randomly distubuted +2-1 in addition to the standart +1), which allows to change system behaviour to the more predictable state

v1.3 - Added one more alternative pattern of sand grains addition into the systems (randomly distubuted +1-1 in addition to the previous ones), which allows to check if systems can stay in the same state

v1.4 - Added two more patterns of sand grains addition (exponential or Pareto distributions for the number of new grains each turn), refactored functions for the creation of new grains

v1.5 - Added alternative implementation of Chung-Lu models with the directed (instead of basic undirected) edges
